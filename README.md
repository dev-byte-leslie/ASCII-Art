# ASCII-Art
A c++ program that draws ASCII art based on values in text files.

All parts of the line are separated by one or more white space characters.

All four parts of a line are positive whole numbers as follows:
-ROW - How far down from the top of the image this character is positioned
-COLUMN - How far out from the left of the image this character is positioned
-CHARACTER - The 'char' value of this character.
-COUNT - How many of these characters are repeated at this location
      For example, the following lineâ€¦
      0 11 @ 6
